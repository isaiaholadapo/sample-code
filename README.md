To set up the provided code after cloning from GitHub, you will need to follow these instructions:

1. Install the required dependencies:
   - Ensure you have Python installed on your system (version 3.6 or higher).
   - Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.
   - Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
     ```shell
     python -m venv env
     ```
   - Activate the virtual environment:
     - For Windows:
       ```shell
       env\Scripts\activate
       ```
     - For macOS/Linux:
       ```shell
       source env/bin/activate
       ```
   - Install the dependencies from the `requirements.txt` file:
     ```shell
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

2. Set up the PostgreSQL database:
   - Make sure you have a PostgreSQL server installed and running.
   - Create a new database and note down the connection details (host, database name, username, and password).

3. Configure the environment variables:
   - Create a file named `.env` in the project directory.
   - Open the `.env` file and add the following lines, replacing the placeholder values with your actual database connection details:
     ```
     HOST=<your_host>
     DATABASE=<your_database>
     DATABASE_USER=<your_username>
     DATABASE_PASSWORD=<your_password>
     ```

4. Run the code:
   - In the terminal or command prompt, make sure you are in the project directory with the virtual environment activated.
   - Execute the following command to run the code:
     ```shell
     python <filename.py>
     ```
     Replace `<filename.py>` with the actual name of the Python file containing the code (e.g., `main.py`).

That's it! The code should now be set up and running, interacting with the PostgreSQL database based on the instructions provided. Make sure you have a PostgreSQL server running and accessible with the provided connection details for successful execution.
